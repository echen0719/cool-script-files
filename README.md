# Programs with Caution Required

There are multiple files in this repository. Most of these are scripts files and others are prerequisites or outputs.

## Current File List: 

- System32 Wiper with Confirmation (for fun, but is dangerous)
- more to come

## Check Hash: 

**Why?** Because corrupt or modified files are dangerous! 

- Windows: certutil -hashfile X:/location/to/file SHA256
- Linux: sha256sum /location/to/file

**Any use of these programs are entirely your responsiblity. Do not install these on other people's computers without their permission. For educational purposes only!!**
